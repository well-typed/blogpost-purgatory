# c2hs manual

Recent `c2hs` releases do not come with a user manual precompiled; instead, the
manual must be called by calling `make`. For convenience, we make a pre-built
manual available here.

To build the manual, the following packages are required (on Ubuntu): 

```
sudo apt install libxml2-utils xsltproc docbook-xml docbook-xsl
```
